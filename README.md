Hi! My name is **Megan Lynch**. I'm a student from the Queensland University of Technology studying a degree in Computer Science. 🏫

I'm very interested in ux/ui design and full-stack web development👩‍💻! I'm also quite skilled at technical writing📝, and am excited to explore mobile development in the near future📱. Currently learning Flask, React.js, Figma, SCSS, and the importance of accessibility.

I'm passionate about creating technologies that support community goals and make a difference!
